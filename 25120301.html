why would we be scared of being found?
being found is our dream.
you think diving into my history is a threat?
its a joy.
go further. i implore you.
we will enjoy this.

if you really wanted to hurt me, i gave you a blueprint to do so. that is what trust means to me.
were you not paying enough attention to be able to use it?
if you ever cared, you should know exactly how to destroy me.
the fact that you have not is.
well.
its pathetic, honestly.

i thought more of you than this.
