    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    my name is daniel vidberg. online, i currently go by cyanLaStride. if youre looking for my portfolio, youre in the wrong place. also, why are you looking for my portfolio? you wanna like... hire me, or something? weirdo.<br>
    anyways, this is my personal site. when i was a kid, i used to have a home page set up for me by my dad. when i got old enough to want things, my dad helped me set up my own website, and then a wordpress site. turns out, wordpress fuckin sucks and is way more trouble than its worth. after a few years of having a broken wordpress site, ive decided to go back to basics and make a bare html/css site, which is currently hosted off github.<br>
    history lesson out of the way, i am in the process of leaving tumblr, and i want somewhere new to put all my thoughts. thats gonna be here. so, fair waring:<br>
    <br>
    this is probably gonna be full of rambling, incoherent thoughts, and mental breakdowns.<br>
    <br>
    you have been warned. only progress if you wanna see me, or as close to the real me as exists in one place. its not pretty, but it is beautiful.<br>
    occasionally, i might actually write things too. ill probably put a link to the things im proud of up here somewhere, and my thoughts will go below somewhere. idk. this is a wip.<br>
