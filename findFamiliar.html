<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Copper Crucible.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A circular building with a central forge, the perpetual fire is fed by a copper dragon statue incorporated into the roof. The wings are fanned out to create the ceiling, his neck snaking down as the grinning ancient wyrm exhales a jetstream of flame to feed the mighty forge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">A snow leopard tabaxi in a white monk's robe with a fur cloak wanders in. At first, they seem startled by the dragon, but once they overcome their fear they approach it with curiosity shining in their eyes.</span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie waves, an orange-tinged eladrin with green hair in a bun.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Good afternoon!"</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">"Greetings. This is an impressive rendering of a Draushum. Who created it?"</span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very thing,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as I am told."</span></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birdsong looks confused, but after his embarrassing display the day he arrived he decides to drop the question.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I see. So, would you be the forge master here?"</span></span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If we have forgemasters, then it's only for a day or so. I'm just the one here now, though in the frankest sense, I am here often.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Whispers, Teddie Whispers. Scholar of the Capital Arcanatory, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in novo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Have you met..." Teddie gestures over to Arix.</span></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Pleasure to meet you, Whispers Teddie Whispers. And no, I haven't had the chance to meet many of the guildmembers, I'm brand new myself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I've lost my place. My name is Call of a Bird from Quiet Peaks. You may call me Birdsong."</span></span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That's a lovely name, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call of a Bird from Quiet Peaks.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ah, but I can use Birdsong if you do prefer.”</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">Still unsure of guild practice, he hesitates, then half-bows.</span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie half bows back, then smiles.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I was just showing our friend here - also new to everything, mind you - a tour of our smithy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm here specifically organizing a fund, where new and old members can contact their familiars and donate to a good cause. Are you familiar with familiars?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie sets a kiln going in the corner.</span></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I... don't believe so?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't know of anyone in particular I'd like to contact.”</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">“Have you spoken to yourself recently?”</span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To... myself?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to practice meditation, I suppose.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does that count?”</span></span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. That sense of self is familiar to me - I trance, and those feelings are very alike.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a physical manifestation of one's own shadow - cast not on objects, but the greater invisible world.”</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">Birdsong has no idea what you're talking about, but is listening intently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">“Did you ever have to cast away a loathsome self-talk while meditating?”</span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In my experience, that's most of the process.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I've since stopped... I found it unhelpful to dwell inside myself.”</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">“I understand. Thoughts can swell up in time.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">“So this... familiar, it's like my mind's shadow?”</span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very much so. Like the shadow of your presence in the world, with its own mind, intent, and actions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One which, as soon as you see it, you Find Familiar.”</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">"Ah." Birdsong does not see what you did there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">“We can try to summon it, if you like.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">“Hmm. Sure, what could go wrong?”</span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie laughs an airy chuckle. “Ah, I'm the least of your worries in this town.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie turns over the kiln, and Birdsong can see churning hot, dark coals, and hear the roaring of spirited fire beneath them, spewing from the red light beneath.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think to yourself of what you felt, those moments you kept your thoughts to yourself. What did you smell? What did you feel?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep those thoughts to yourself, but feel them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birdsong closes his eyes, and curiously his body naturally falls into an open combat stance. He seems at peace.
</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">If Teddie has ever seen a monk prepare for battle, this looks familiar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">She has.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">“What now?”</span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff9900;">Birdsong starts to smell numerous herbs and scents wafting by his nose. Peppermint. Honey. Basil. Lavender.</span>
</span></span><span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more come by.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How familiar are these? Tell me when to stop.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of any scent to choose, from a wider selection than those just stated, which might Birdsong connect to most?</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">These scents are too rich for Birdsong's taste, the scents he connects to most are those of pinewood, sweat, and blood.</span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie's really scraping the bottom of the barrel when she comes to pinewood, and the sweat is most definitely hers from the exhaustion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“...Alright.” She skips the pinewood into the ashen mixture.</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">Yeah, half of the things you offer him he has literally never smelled before. He is delighted by each one.</span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie lets Birdsong keep the honeycomb, and hands him a black iron poker.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, crouch here by the kiln, and start to turn the ashes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be hard, but stick with it. You will start to know what form you wish it to take as you try.”</span></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He does so.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accepts the honeycomb with a raised eyebrow and wide smile.</span></span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ashes burst and crackle with light as he does so, streaking light across the now-dark smithy. Like a torrent of bestial mouths, cracks form in the charcoal mass as Birdsong turns it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">POP! A burnt fray of coal bursts out onto Birdsong's hand. Reflexively he might reach back, but he finds no feeling of harm, and by sight, no burn either…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen to it closer. What form are you starting to hear?”</span></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birdsong leans in, focusing hard. Slowly, the excited curiosity in his eyes fade, and is slowly replaced with... something more serious.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I... I think I know what this is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You now recognise the emotion as dread.</span></span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[...]</span></i>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bursting from the flames, a tiny golden dragon emerges, flying directly towards Birdsong's face. Birdsong stumbles backwards, fear catching his outcry in his throat. The golden dragon flies around the forge, dipping and diving around the statue before finally settling on the edge of the forge nearest Birdsong.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“...”</span></span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lovely.”</span></i></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birdsong's eyes have gone completely flat. He launches an accusatory gaze at Teddie, but then softens and mumbles something to himself. Standing up, he faces the dragon.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don't want it.”</span></span>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“...”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teddie's expression drops.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looks back at the dragon with curious eyes.</span></span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dragon returns the gaze, tilting its head.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems friendly enough.</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">Teddie takes back up the pinewood, and runs it near the dragon's mouth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">The dragon shies back. It seems to dislike the scent.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">“...was this an unhappy memory, Birdsong?”</span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“...</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What am I supposed to do with it?”</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">“Whatever you like.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3d638e;">“...”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">"It will follow you, and you can dismiss it from yourself with just a thought."</span>

<span style="color: #3d638e;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birdsong stares at the dragon. After a moment, he turns away. He can't seem to bring himself to dismiss it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“...</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have work to do.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birdsong walks out. The dragon takes off, does a lil loop-de-loop, and follows him.</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ff9900;">Teddie steps back to the stand's counter, and watches him leave.</span>
