finally finished hades. what an incredible game.
also played milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk. that was neat and short, and i regret not playing it a year ago.

went sledding today. had a ton of fun. laughed a lot. i was by myself, but i didnt mind.

finally used the spare bed last night, too. it was nice not waking up alone in a room. actually encouraged me to get up at 10am, which is how i was able to do so much today.

the lesson?

this is life.
help others.
laugh on your own.
commit to challenge.
live well.
