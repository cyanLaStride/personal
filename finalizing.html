    <h2>finalizing</h2>
  okay. i guess this works. how do you feel about this?<br>
  im not sure. seems kinda inefficient. if its too hard to access this then thoughts may not get written down as often.<br>
  but.<br>
  but its a place to call home! somewhere, our own corner of the internet that we have almost complete control over. and still enough work done for us thats its easy, ish.<br>
  so you like it?<br>
  i think so? i hope so. we'll see if we actually use it or not. figuring out how to get here on mobile might be a bit of a task.<br>
  and all the brs....<br>
  yeah adding br after every line is annoying. theres probably a way to automate that. but also, its kinda nice? to go through everything, just as kindof a recap.<br>
  it makes linebreaks more important.<br>
  it adds a weight to them, yeah. i think i might actually be a fan.<br>
  i could be convinced.<br>
  and hey, look, we didnt waste the entire time!<br>
  hooray<br>
  hooray!!<br>
  i hope they actually still wanna go to the mall or whatever. otherwise i... guess we could join the online class we're skipping?<br>
  boooooo<br>
  yeah i dont want to either.<br>
  dont get me wrong, i love the prof and this class has been fun.<br>
  we're just in a rebellious mood.<br>
  yeah >:)<br>
<br>
<br>
  yaknow, this is actually nice. it feels... right, yaknow? like this is where we were meant to end up.<br>
  lazy, and self-determining.<br>
  yeah.<br>
  yeah, it feels good. i like it.<br>
  im glad. i like it too.<br>
  until we see how it is on mobile, of course.<br>
  oh yeah. if its a huge pain then none of this is gonna work.<br>
  mhm.<br>
  but still.<br>
  but still!<br>
  ~feels good.<br>
