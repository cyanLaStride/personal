what do i need to do?<br>
<br>
level design is due next monday<br>
worldbuilding is due next friday<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
so what are we actually doing today?<br>
great question.<br>
the earlier i finish level design, the sooner the only thing on my plate will be worldbuilding. it would be kinda poggers if i could actually straight up finish and submit that before next monday.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
monday - today, not doing anything<br>
tuesday - capstone final<br>
wednesday - phoenix?<br>
thursday - or is this phoenix? one of these needs to be schoolwork day<br>
friday - work<br>
saturday - work<br>
sunday - work<br>
monday - due<br>
<br>
so wednesday then. thats the day when we'll start, and then we'll finish on thursday. while then gives us the entire next week to work on anchor. sounds good?<br>
i dont wanna work on this right now<br>
well do something. how about setting up your website?<br>
yeah already i can do that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

ye still could<br>
nooo we cannttt there less than a n hour left everyone knows thats not enough time to do ANYTHING<br>
yeah alright fair<br>
oh i remember the goal now<br>
it was to set up a page to be our new journal instead of tumblr<br>
i guess we can still do that<br>
how should we like. format it.<br>
idk<br>
<br>
maybe we just make a site to start. like a new one.<br>
orrrr we could just stick it on the portfolio site<br>
we can copy the portfolio site. i kina dont want to have this on the portfolio site ever just in case, yaknow? but we can make like. a personal one.<br>
alright yeah lets do that.<br>
<br>
duplicating a repo sounds hard. lets just make a new repo and then move all the files.<br>
